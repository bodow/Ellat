Usage
------
### Text Mode
To transcript greel text, you can input the text into the greek text box, by
these four ways:
- Input text using your **Keyboard**
- Use your mouse to **Drag'n'Drop** text into the text box
- Load text from **File**, using the 'File->Load Greek text' or (Ctrl+O) option
 
You can save the transcripted text, using the 'File->Save Latin text' or by
pressing the (Ctrl+S) shorthcut. 
 
Also, at the 'File' menu, you can find the option to change the text boxes Font
family, size or effects. 
 
From the 'Edit' menu, you can quickly paste greek text (F2). or copy latin text
to the clipboard (F3). Also you can change the case of the transcripted text,
to Uppercase (F5), Lowercase (F6), or leaving it as imputed (F4). Finally you
have options, to replace spaces with Hyphens (F7), Underscores (F8), Trim them
(F9), or leaving them 'As-Is' (F10). These options may be useful for the the
'Files Mode' described next. 

### Files Mode
To use Ellat as file renamer, you simply drag'n'drop a file from your desktop
to the greek text box. Immediately the in latin text box, are showing the new
transcripted file names. At the status bar, a new drop down button appearing,
with selections for renaming, doing copies with new names, or quit this
'Files mode'. Except files, Ellat support the renaming of folders, but no copy
creation for them. After the renaming, you can drag'n'drop new files at the
greek box, to do the same process. The status of the processing, when its
started, is showing at the lating box. A system sound notify you for the end
of the process.
